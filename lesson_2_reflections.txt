What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- when you init a new repo u create a empty repo with no commits
and there are may be files that are untracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The working directory is the directory on ur pc where your files are, the staging area comes before the commit
by gives us a way to control which files to commit at once and the repository is the place where we want to commit our files.
