How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
- It helped me by showing me the contents of both files
piece by piece, each encapsulated in its own tags. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- It is heplful because u can easily go back to previous working versions of your code if you mess it up
and you can also see everyone who has commited changes on the document and when this exactly happened.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
- Pros of manual commit: always logical, not to many unnecessary commits
- Cons of manual commit: u may forget to commit, not enough commits, cant have history on a given time basis unless u are very strict

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Because different projects require different ways of dealing with files. In some cases you need to commit all files in ones,
and in other cases you don't. When you commit all files no mater you have made any changes to all of them or just one of them 
you taka up more space on your cloud or ur pc, google docs use cloud computing so its not efficient to save files with identical 
content more than once. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- git log gives a list of all the commits with their id-s and comments and git diff first-id second-id gives the changes between the
two commits made 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- It can make u more confident by letting make changes knowing that any time u can go back to a previous working version and restore it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- I want to use git to manage my future projects and control their versions.
